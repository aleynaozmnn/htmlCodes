        <p>In this study, the emulator circuit proposed by Mutlu et al., which gives a stable output curve in terms of application was used. The quality factor, cut-off frequencies and bandwidths of the circuit on passive and active filters were evaluated. It was observed that the quality factor of memristor-based filters was higher because the memristor is self-excited at low frequency points (≤ 100Hz). At high frequencies, it was observed that there was no positive effect since the output response of both active and passive filter circuits based on memristor behaved like a linear resistor.</p>
